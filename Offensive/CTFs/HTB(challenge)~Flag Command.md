However, there's a trick to escaping! By inspecting the website's code, you'll uncover the author way to proceed.

After that, you're presented with four options. But once again, none of these options lead to victory.
So, with our secret, we do not need to go above steps actually

So, just like before, you'll need to dig deeper into the code. That's where you'll find the api, which holds the key to your escape.
